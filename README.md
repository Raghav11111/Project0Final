# Project0Final

Hi! My name is Raghav and I am a student in 9th grade from India. I have always had interest in programming and the rich culture 
of my country. So in this project I decided to share just a gist of what my country and culture is about through my interest 
of programming. The project includes a table of some of the Prime Ministers of India, a grid on the Festivals of India,
two columns giving information about the most popular foods of India and finally a page telling us about India's neighbors.

 I hope you find the project interesting. Thank you.
